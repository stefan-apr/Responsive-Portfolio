                Hi! My name is Stefan Apreutesei, and I’m a software developer. My journey to this point has been an unconventional, but interesting and fun experience. I started off by taking as many Computer Science courses as I could at the University of Washington, but ultimately earned my degree in Earth Sciences with a GIS focus.

                Looking for more opportunities to study Computer Science, I went on to complete a postgraduate Web Development bootcamp with the University of Washington. This environment put into perspective what software development, particularly as part of a team, is like. The coursework prepared me well in modern web development technologies; I greatly enjoyed making our team projects take shape, and I’m proud of the portfolio I’ve put together since.
            </p>

            <p class="bP" class="bPSpan">
                Now searching for my next step along the path, I’m looking forward to contributing towards writing impactful software in the workforce.
