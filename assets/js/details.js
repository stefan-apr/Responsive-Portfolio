Users can search for events using a variety of search terms, and see the results both on a map and as a paginated list. When they click on a result in the list, the app shows the weather forecast for the event (if the event is more than 7 days in the future, historical average data is presented). The app also shows a list of types of events that have recently been searched for.",

We maintain an open database, allowing any user to download and use collected data as they see fit. As climate change causes our seasons to shift, seasonal events are affected in kind. On average, winters are shortening, summers are lengthening, and the timings of seasonal events are changing. The purpose of SenSaison is to record the timing of such seasonal events to improve our understanding of how these changes work and how they will affect us in the short- and long-term. On their account page, users are able to create new observations, search for local observations around themselves or any chosen location, and view the observations they have made in the past. Any user is also able to download a file containing observations filtered however they would like. These files are distributed in .csv format.",
